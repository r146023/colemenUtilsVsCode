Explode by Delimiter--
Finds the most commonly occuring non-alphanumeric character and splits the file by it.

It ignores spaces,newlines, carriage returns, double and single quotes.

Delimiters that are wrapped within quotes, like "daphne, you bitch" will be ignored as well.
You can also escape the delimiter by doubling it:

"daphne, you bitch" => daphne, you bitch
